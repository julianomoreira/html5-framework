	<h2>Story of the office</h2>
	<p>Did you ever wanted to be have an office and couldn't afford? Well, Don't feel bad becaus you're not the only one. The cheap solution for someone who really need to have an office is Linux. Unless you can afford Windows Server 2003 (lots of fees), you're going to want to end up with a solution that you can afford. In my case, I spent about $0 (zero) dollars. You can pretty much get an old computer, in my case an old Dell Computer, install Fedora (I have Fedora 11 but any version works) and ran bunch of goodies with it. Pretty cool!</p>
